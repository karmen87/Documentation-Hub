steps:
  - step_number: 1
    step_title: "Welcome to the Studio"
    narrator_script: "The Lamatic Studio serves as the core Visual Layer, a comprehensive Graphical User Interface built on top of the Core Layer logic.[1] It is the centralized platform designed for managing, building, and deploying all GenAI projects.[1] The Studio is where both technical and non-technical users configure, monitor, and maintain system operations and flows, providing a streamlined control panel for your entire organization.[1]"
    on_screen_text:
      - "Centralized GUI (Visual Layer)"

      - "For Technical and Non-Technical Users"
    action_visual_cue: "Display a wide shot of the Lamatic Studio dashboard, emphasizing the GUI layout."
  - step_number: 2
    step_title: "Managing Organizations and Projects"
    narrator_script: "Project management begins at the top level, allowing you to **Switch Organizations** and **Switch Projects** within your organization.[1] Studio Projects are flexible containers that facilitate multi-team collaboration and enable the assignment of specific **Member Roles** and permissions.[1] This is also where you manage global **Variables & Secrets** for reusable data and sensitive API keys across the project.[1]"

    action_visual_cue: "Highlight the top navigation bar showing the 'Switch Organization' and 'Switch Project' controls."
  - step_number: 3
    step_title: "Flow and Agent Management"
    narrator_script: "The **Flow Management** section is the critical hub for core application logic.[1] Here, you can **Create a New Flow** to define automation processes, configure specialized **Agents** (like the Text or JSON Agent), and maintain your reusable **Prompt Library** and **Tools**.[1] This area is where your AI components are visually assembled using the flow editor.[1]"
    on_screen_text:
      - "Create New Flows and Agents"
      - "Manage Prompt Library and Tools"
      - "Define Core Application Logic"
    action_visual_cue: "Zoom in on the left navigation panel, highlighting 'Flows', 'Agents', and 'Prompt Library'."
  - step_number: 4
    step_title: "Context and Data Handling"
    narrator_script: "The **Data/Database (Context)** area is vital for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and conversational memory.[1] This section lets you store and manage **Vector Embeddings** in the Vector Store, and configure the **Memory Store**.[1] Proper context management ensures your agents have access to custom, relevant, and historical knowledge to generate accurate responses.[1]"
    on_screen_text:
      - "Store Vector Embeddings (Vector Store)"
      - "Manage AI Memory/Context"
      - "Essential for RAG Use Cases"
    action_visual_cue: "Show a graphic illustrating the Data/Context management section with icons for Vector Store and Memory Store."
  - step_number: 5
    step_title: "Connecting External Models and Integrations"
    narrator_script: "Under **Connection Management**, you link your projects to external services.[1] This includes managing available **LLM Models**, setting up **Integrations** with third-party data sources, and configuring the **Interface** components.[1] The Interface allows you to customize the embeddable **Chat** and **Search Widgets** for user-facing applications.[1]"
    on_screen_text:
      - "Add LLM Models and Integrations"
      - "Configure Chat and Search Widgets"
      - "Manage External API Connections"
    action_visual_cue: "Highlight the 'LLM Models', 'Integrations', and 'Interface' sections in the navigation."
  - step_number: 6
    step_title: "Testing and Quality Assurance"
    narrator_script: "For quality assurance, the Studio offers dedicated sections for **Testing** and **Scheduled Jobs**.[1] The Testing area allows you to create test cases for Flow, Prompt, and Code validation to confirm functionality before deployment.[1] The Scheduled Jobs section is where you manage and track automated batch processes running on a fixed timetable.[1]"
    on_screen_text:
      - "Create Test Cases (Flow, Prompt, Code)"
      - "Validate Functionality Before Release"
      - "Manage Automated Batch Processes (Jobs)"
    action_visual_cue: "Show the 'Testing' and 'Scheduled Jobs' navigation links being clicked sequentially."
  - step_number: 7
    step_title: "Monitoring, Logs, and Reports"
    narrator_script: "Operational visibility is found under **Monitoring and Deployment**.[1] **Logs** record all incoming requests, allowing developers to query them for detailed analysis and debugging.[1] **Deployments** track production releases, while **Reports** provide high-level analytics on performance, usage, and cost.[1] Additionally, the Studio centralizes **Billing Management**, consolidating investment visibility across all projects.[1]"
    on_screen_text:
      - "Logs: Query All Incoming Requests"
      - "Deployments: Manage Production Releases"
      - "Reports: View Performance and Cost Analytics"
      - "Centralized Billing Management"
    action_visual_cue: "Display a screenshot of the Logs query interface and then transition to a view of the Reports dashboard."
  - step_number: 8
    step_title: "Tutorial Complete!"
    narrator_script: "You have now completed the comprehensive tour of the Lamatic Studio, understanding how to navigate project management, flows, and monitoring tools. You are now prepared to dive deeper into the Flow Editor and master the configuration of nodes in the next tutorial."
    on_screen_text:
